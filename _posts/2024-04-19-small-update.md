title: A Small Update
---

Continuing on with my ventures into 3D sculpting, texture painting and UV mapping, I haven't done a lot for the game directly this week. I'll probably keep working on my asset creation skills on the side to get more comfortable with the tools and figure out what sort of visual styles and effects I like. And I have a bit of an alternative plan for the future.

I'll probably be shelving work on this game for a little while, as I've been struggling with a lack of planning and motivation to move this game forward from where I am now. 

I've heard different flavors of a similar type of difficult advice going around for solo developers: focus on both developing your skills in as many projects as possible and also try to see games through to release. I suppose the right interpretation is that a combination of both small and big projects provides the most experience with different kinds of challenges, rather than getting bogged down in some problem that prevents a single project from moving forward. I think I'll be heeding that advice for the near future, especially since I want to get more experience programming different systems. On top of that, I'd also like to be more useful as a member of a future dev team by focusing on developing my currently (more practicable) coding skills.

I plan on taking a break for a little while and trying out a smaller side project, which I might be able to provide an update on for the coming post. It'll probably be smaller in scope and give me more time to focus on developing around a smaller set of mechanics, like my first Godot game Constellation Finder. No guarantees on how long it will take; I might even rotate between these two projects, maybe more, since I haven't really figured out yet whether I prefer to work on several simultaneously or stick to one at a time.
