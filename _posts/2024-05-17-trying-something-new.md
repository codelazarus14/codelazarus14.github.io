title: Trying Something New
---

Well, I suppose it's been a little longer than a week or two. I've been up to quite a lot in the short time span and have a bit more to show off as well. 

My previous side project, which I alluded to in the last post before the posting hiatus, was focused on building a smaller-scope game in 2D from scratch to give myself a more focused project, with specific requirements and systems in mind, rather than the confounding, infinite void of possibility I was running into with the last game. It's not "shelved" in a bad way right now, but I'm realizing that my preference for structure and a sense of purpose in design is probably more important to me than going in without much of a structure at all and hoping that it emerges spontaneously. 

I started with a basic idea after reading Tom Standage's *The Victorian Internet* that a good, simpler idea for a game would be simulating the job of a telegraph operator in the 1850s or so. It would be somewhat like Lucas Pope's work which has been fairly inspirational for me - smaller games with specific historical settings, and using the structure of unexciting office work to build a story around. On top of using (simplifed) Morse code, communicating with other operators and working against time pressures and personal needs, it would have a mix of smaller and larger stories experienced through this lens and perhaps outside the office or after hours when there is time to engage with the world beyond. 

I built most of the basic systems for receiving, sending and handling messages on their ways around the office, but ultimately I started to feel like I was drifting again. I had a plan for the art direction using collages and cutouts of Victorian magazines, but the scope of the game was still unclear - how would I differentiate it as a *Papers, Please* ripoff and also use my own ideas to alter that format? It's also been less than a month, so nothing is final, and I guess this one can be considered "shelved" for now. I like the idea of a shelf though, a readily-accessible set of WIPs to revisit after being struck with inspiration, picking one up and working on it to gain inspiration or insight about a problem in another WIP. I guess this isn't how things are done in production but I am very grateful to not be working under those constraints.

New project time - an RTS. One of the most fleshed-out concepts I had for a new game was mostly inspired by my love of old RTS and CRPG aesthetics and my time playing the Age of Empires games as a kid. I won't go into too much detail, but the original nebulous fantasy of a game was intended to be an RPG-RTS hybrid, like a blend of RTS squad mechanics from *Company of Heroes* but more directly inspired by the newer *Aliens: Fireteam* game, the original *Diablo*, and *Age of Empires: II*. Aesthetically, I love the old pixelated/early CGI hybrid aesthetic of those games and have obviously spent a lot of time admiring details in AOE II over the years I played it. Nostalgia is cliche, I guess, but it has also been a great force for recognizing the timelessness of certain experiences. In game development terms, I was a little concerned about the scope of the project at first and wanted to avoid something too ambitious (we can see how that's going with the underwater game). With a little more experience under my belt, I'm now optimistic about a project that I have been and would hopefully continue to be interested in working on, due to the vast range of moderately-challenging and detail-oriented features to implement.

I might spend more of next week talking about the new game project, since I'd probably need a whole new post to start talking about my ideas for it. This week, I've mostly been working on implementing standard isometric top-down camera features and, \*gasp\*, returning to Unity. Talk about nostalgia - I've already started to miss a lot of the nice features of working in C#; Godot was a fun experience to get into in the last year but it's definitely a bit short of advanced tools and documentation. By far, my favorite feature of Godot is how lightweight it is compared to watching Unity grind through the initial boot and successively-slower assembly reloads. I also appreciate Godot's being a little more focused in its implementations of features like input mapping and UI than Unity, though maybe this is just the advantage of hindsight. Building a custom inspector just to handle camera zoom properties this week was kind of a headache compared to the ease of `@export`ing in Godot.

Moving forward, I hope to keep a more consistent pace with updates on the current project, and how my game dev experiments are going in general. I'm still full of ideas for this RTS thing which I've been sitting on for quite a while, and it should keep me occupied with building systems and new features that rely on my understanding of a genre, rather than something as free form as the underwater game. Here's a few screenshots of what I was working on, and where I'll be going.

So far, I built up the basic gameplay loop with drag-and-drop containers for transferring messages around the different parts of the office. They're all built out of UI Controls, which would probably still dominate a large part of the final game as well, but then I'd try to make them look more diegetic.

The inbox's title label is colored white to indicate interactability, while the outbox is colored red to show interaction is disabled. Read messages are white, one message under the cursor is blue, and the unread messages are yellow.](/../assets/images/blog/0007/ingame.png)

I spent some time working on unread messages and marking them as read when interacted with, along with updating a little notification counter on the main screen (not depicted). This would be useful for determining when new messages have either been dropped in the operator's inbox or received through the sounder/transcriber I set up for debugging.

Each character is accompanied by its Morse code representation beneath it.](/../assets/images/blog/0007/ingame2.png)

Sending is the main interactive feature, and probably the most easy to map from a debuggable prototype to gameplay. I wasn't sure whether to make receiving depend on the player's ability to transcribe Morse or just use a printed tape as a backup with some kind of time penalty for scrolling through the tape, or maybe use both in some combination with a difficulty setting.

Moving on...

Humble beginnings. I promise I'll see something through to conclusion, eventually. But this has only been a few days' worth of effort and it's honestly still quite fresh for me, I have quite a list of things to tackle up next. Maybe unit selection (single, box-select, double clicking etc.).
