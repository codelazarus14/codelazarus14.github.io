In college I took an introductory artificial intelligence course which spent a lot of time discussing algorithms for playing board games and implementing them in LISP. One of the assignments was to implement an Othello AI that gradually improves its strategy by simulating the outcomes of playing different moves on each turn, as described in [this paper](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271585/1-s2.0-S0004370211X0005X/1-s2.0-S000437021100052X/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEcaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQCMmNNvW1uZqt%2B2B2MGXGcHfIwQm%2F0QdgM5krdI8fFVhQIhAJ9VbXzK0w7a4P8ha6RA6KtUeaOwbzjF63o%2Fw06JyY%2BdKrIFCGAQBRoMMDU5MDAzNTQ2ODY1IgzRGQLacB3lRjVM5AcqjwXaXBXdxhlOcFi1ST2r11XKiE749qEVaEDTSUJxeLxIuEbPYG5Z3EL74X5VvPYdnUx0MM98dlEBLnhuCFbKBFOvx%2F6KpdVnBCz1933Qg%2Bd%2BYGDEiWCU15fzaleFSYmNXZRqsoABTf7APSCu4%2F1Sdvc3Jo9prOf%2B3vsa9TsXMnB7gRMwFyYQWGNlJ09SDPMCaCaRGE9V1atqu6V8y%2BSb7Wye4UcTF3%2BdW5hSRIIPvlbq5t7hTeZ2NXZdxNMEKcpsXheelAGwzswG7MvKBdEtgUVkeBUhOgv2z7rEexHofIReJYHQxdpyZMlnjZV02P3gnSXbVLJKSVJZHwMsMGUUME0avEL%2Bklv6TzxnjiWVvwl0qM1b7Jb40RH16UYYjz284E6S9PcmFHg4QWkkvEXAJY811dXQEPSeToCl4lXsW6E8YJML6y7kBKfvOTnedhG9%2F%2F7bP8PpcDVhn2fBB%2BSuq%2FFasU84yvzSk%2Fkwl9NcsLrVJifZqHZrzNVnv8nb%2BJsYlkOYej%2BZuHIrvvaLrenlBs2CmiE2v2fuY9%2F8qz2w%2BrboGoxzTwnXZNe%2BxooyXxFb5iqokQK2M%2FL5oWOsdaETuhMo%2F7l3PRQjWnvJsJci7HoCwUXA98DFlqqThJufR4XntzPOOuUiV%2Fv%2BVo6D3g7MJLI7YDwZWJbIP4WB7iupn43oXtajZLxfiuI4gY1Lsg6CRINw3RgGHvGOqOsWquxrmS1e61V5tT7Ud5KHlYUmBjHWkKSVdkIXNWx%2Bs42uKKnygYoFzlYGftF7hUui30txA35fXoRwMa%2BJmCJDFm0AGYvnSodklDz0ZSFIY5Sa%2Bsy020WvfoBiWD9lw%2F8BxSHjFdtjT9SvRskC7oXWbHy5AtTaMIDzr6kGOrABT9cn2VGZxfPV4bNNUTt%2BPqVj3vbQx0ZfeOpKxcNnkMIX4yycsCb%2FHwEum7Fgr31x1n6nFa46LRnGAkL5XvDuJQ4x8pCZlhPwpIw7iq5XHHk4pl9QKb%2FHrbaOckUzuda%2FakO7mFXH0wsVc75w9WSNZAuBtxtBBxhJ7RQRzTLTr5%2Fg9LQm%2BTVoUUSDsK%2BUh78Bsq1qttNQqT3HWDVeOGLtiL9SrZ8zwcLEbM4UrH2XYxw%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20231015T155331Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY2RDKYOU7%2F20231015%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=2c1998e496c83e3df02771a2b7b3464c15e1b43b24bd9f1cb36600f048c1d134&hash=213f85b02df4961b846e9ef1e49c5b6bf9ca5e857be900796649aed7af038afc&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S000437021100052X&tid=spdf-fb2eada1-00ab-449a-80f3-c4983b6b77a2&sid=e29925a853e8f240db19d0704cb04905b466gxrqa&type=client&tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&ua=13105751555e54015251&rr=81693c427b016356&cc=us). The final step was to repeatedly pit the AI against a copy of itself, each with its own parameters, in order to determine what values should be used to improve their win rate.

Some months after I had submitted the assignment and finished the course, I dug out the source code again to see if I could improve on it, partly out of nostalgia. As a kid, I had played against my mom with her old pocket Othello set, but neither of us had thought about strategy as much as passing the time.

The program I had submitted depended on pre-written data structures for the game and its rules, which I found concerningly fragile while trying to write an AI dependent on them. I began by translating the whole program into C++ while fixing various bugs and redundancies in the original design. After I was satisfied with the text-based version, I added an OpenGL-based GUI with custom UI elements that made playing moves, pausing and editing the game's settings more straightforward.
