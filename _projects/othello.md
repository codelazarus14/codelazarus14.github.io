In college I took an introductory course to AI in which we spent the majority of our time studying simple, deterministic environments with simple goals, like winning a game of chess or shortest-path through a graph. One of our assignments was to implement an algorithm for playing Othello as described in [this paper](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271585/1-s2.0-S0004370211X0005X/1-s2.0-S000437021100052X/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEcaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQCMmNNvW1uZqt%2B2B2MGXGcHfIwQm%2F0QdgM5krdI8fFVhQIhAJ9VbXzK0w7a4P8ha6RA6KtUeaOwbzjF63o%2Fw06JyY%2BdKrIFCGAQBRoMMDU5MDAzNTQ2ODY1IgzRGQLacB3lRjVM5AcqjwXaXBXdxhlOcFi1ST2r11XKiE749qEVaEDTSUJxeLxIuEbPYG5Z3EL74X5VvPYdnUx0MM98dlEBLnhuCFbKBFOvx%2F6KpdVnBCz1933Qg%2Bd%2BYGDEiWCU15fzaleFSYmNXZRqsoABTf7APSCu4%2F1Sdvc3Jo9prOf%2B3vsa9TsXMnB7gRMwFyYQWGNlJ09SDPMCaCaRGE9V1atqu6V8y%2BSb7Wye4UcTF3%2BdW5hSRIIPvlbq5t7hTeZ2NXZdxNMEKcpsXheelAGwzswG7MvKBdEtgUVkeBUhOgv2z7rEexHofIReJYHQxdpyZMlnjZV02P3gnSXbVLJKSVJZHwMsMGUUME0avEL%2Bklv6TzxnjiWVvwl0qM1b7Jb40RH16UYYjz284E6S9PcmFHg4QWkkvEXAJY811dXQEPSeToCl4lXsW6E8YJML6y7kBKfvOTnedhG9%2F%2F7bP8PpcDVhn2fBB%2BSuq%2FFasU84yvzSk%2Fkwl9NcsLrVJifZqHZrzNVnv8nb%2BJsYlkOYej%2BZuHIrvvaLrenlBs2CmiE2v2fuY9%2F8qz2w%2BrboGoxzTwnXZNe%2BxooyXxFb5iqokQK2M%2FL5oWOsdaETuhMo%2F7l3PRQjWnvJsJci7HoCwUXA98DFlqqThJufR4XntzPOOuUiV%2Fv%2BVo6D3g7MJLI7YDwZWJbIP4WB7iupn43oXtajZLxfiuI4gY1Lsg6CRINw3RgGHvGOqOsWquxrmS1e61V5tT7Ud5KHlYUmBjHWkKSVdkIXNWx%2Bs42uKKnygYoFzlYGftF7hUui30txA35fXoRwMa%2BJmCJDFm0AGYvnSodklDz0ZSFIY5Sa%2Bsy020WvfoBiWD9lw%2F8BxSHjFdtjT9SvRskC7oXWbHy5AtTaMIDzr6kGOrABT9cn2VGZxfPV4bNNUTt%2BPqVj3vbQx0ZfeOpKxcNnkMIX4yycsCb%2FHwEum7Fgr31x1n6nFa46LRnGAkL5XvDuJQ4x8pCZlhPwpIw7iq5XHHk4pl9QKb%2FHrbaOckUzuda%2FakO7mFXH0wsVc75w9WSNZAuBtxtBBxhJ7RQRzTLTr5%2Fg9LQm%2BTVoUUSDsK%2BUh78Bsq1qttNQqT3HWDVeOGLtiL9SrZ8zwcLEbM4UrH2XYxw%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20231015T155331Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY2RDKYOU7%2F20231015%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=2c1998e496c83e3df02771a2b7b3464c15e1b43b24bd9f1cb36600f048c1d134&hash=213f85b02df4961b846e9ef1e49c5b6bf9ca5e857be900796649aed7af038afc&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S000437021100052X&tid=spdf-fb2eada1-00ab-449a-80f3-c4983b6b77a2&sid=e29925a853e8f240db19d0704cb04905b466gxrqa&type=client&tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&ua=13105751555e54015251&rr=81693c427b016356&cc=us). Our code would pit two computer players against each other, taking turns continuously until one player was defeated or the game was tied.

The assignment was fairly straightforward, but some months after I dug out the source code again to see if I could improve on it, partly out of nostalgia. I had spent many road trips and slow summer days playing Othello, but I had never thought about strategy as much as this algorithm strove to perfect.

I was curious about whether I could improve on it. Some time later I began converting the LISP code we had written for the class into C++ and later added a GUI version. On top of having to create UI elements from scratch such as buttons and a pause menu, the final version of the game also fixes a random seeding error from the original LISP version.
