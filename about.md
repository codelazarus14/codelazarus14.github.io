This website is where I (Sam Catterall) keep a list of various projects I've worked on. 

I've been making small experiments off and on since I first got into coding in high school. More recently, I've spent time exploring new frontiers like 3D rendering with OpenGL, Python chatbots, modding [one of my favorite video games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/) and developing websites.

To find out more about what else I'm working on, you can visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/codelazarus14) or contact me at [codel1763@gmail.com]().
